# SingleLinkedList
A singly linked list. I wrote a sequential iterator (Forward iterator) for it. A strict security guarantee is provided. Unit tests were written.
# Building and Run
```
  1. mkdir BuildSingleLinkedList && cd BuildSingleLinkedList
  2. cmake ..
  3. cmake --build .
  4. Start ./list or list.exe
```
# System requirements and Stack
  1. C++17
  2. GCC version 8.1.0
  3. Cmake 3.21.2 (minimal 3.10)
  4. Forward iterator
# Future plans
