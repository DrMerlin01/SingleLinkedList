# SingleLinkedList
A singly linked list. I wrote a sequential iterator (Forward iterator) for it. A strict security guarantee is provided. Unit tests were written.
# Building and Run
GCC is used for the assembly:
  1. g++ SingleLinkedList.cpp -Wall -Werror -std=c++17 -o list
  2. Start ./list or list.exe
# System requirements and Stack
  1. C++17
  2. GCC version 8.1.0
  3. Forward iterator
# Future plans
  1. Add a script to build the project
  2. Split the project into files
